                <h2>A Review of HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is a simple programming language. It is made up of normal text, inside of these "<" and ">". The best part of HTML is that it is simple, and once you understand a basic concept, it opens the door to larger, more complext
                    concepts.

            <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
            <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly naviage to new pages, both within and outside of the current website.</p>
            <p>
                For instance, they can quickly direct users to
                <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google's Homepage</a>
            </p>
            <p><a href="mailto:nkoby@student.mamkschools.org">Emails</a> can also be easily sent through the use of links.</p>
            <p>
                <a href="#top">They can even bring user to a certain place within a webpage.</a>

            <h3><u>Images</u></h3>
            <p>
                <img align="left" src="images/tigers.jpeg" />
                Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" atribute, with a value of "left" is a perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the
                value in the "align" atribute to "right".
